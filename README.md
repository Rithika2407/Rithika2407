✨ Hey, I'm Rithika!

AI/ML engineer by brain, designer by heart, student by day, and “let’s-build-something-cool” person 24/7.
I love mixing machine learning + creativity to build projects that actually do something — not just sit in a folder called “final_final_really_final.ipynb”.

.
What I Do :
Build models that caption images without ever being trained on them (zero-shot gang)
Make sense of chaotic EEG data
Create RAG systems that actually answer the question instead of hallucinating confidently
Teach YOLO to detect potholes better than the actual municipality
Design clean UIs because ugly dashboards ruin my mood
Do a little too much with LLMs sometimes

🛠 Tech I Love Using

Python · PyTorch · TensorFlow · LangChain · FAISS · Llama/Falcon models · OpenCV · YOLO · W&B · Colab
And of course, Figma, because good UI is therapy.
